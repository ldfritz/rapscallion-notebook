# Go HTTP

Here I am mostly concerned with understanding some routing concepts.
I stick to using the standard library.
But I looked at ways to control the routing other than simply the default mux.

`hello.go` is a very simple server that calls a function and returns a string.

`hello-complex.go` implements a different model for controlling the routing.
